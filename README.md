# InstaClone

Instaclone Backend.

## What's this for?

<h3>
I agree that making simmilar things doesn't help my poor idea skills, but It defenitly helps my programming skills,
I wish I could practice new stacks for cool service that I would make someday
</h3>



## Backend stacks

* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) 

**ORM system which is very cool, provides visual editing tool**

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 

**SQL typed Database, friendly to the PRISMA**

* [graphql](https://graphql.org/) 

**A query language for API of my PROJECT, very cool, prevents overfetch and underfetch**



## how to test? 

* git clone this repo

* run ```npm i ```or``` yarn``` ( npm recommended for this project )

* make .env file in root dir

* set DATABASE_URL variable on env, leads to postgreSQL database

* pgadmin4 for window, postico for mac 

* prisma command is already setted


```bash 
npm run migrate
``` 

```bash 
npm run studio
```
